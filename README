Project for OO Architecture class at UChicago.

EIP Patterns used:
	-Aggregator (Summarizing messages at the Precinct to send to the ElectionCenter, 
	see Precinct.java and MyAggregationStrategy.java)
	-Endpoint (Used in multiple places: from BallotMaker to Precinct, Precinct to ElectionCenter)
	-Polling Consumer (Used by electionCenter to receive summary messages from queue)
	-Message (Ballots are messages of a specific format)
	-Message router (Ballots are routed to precinct queues, then summaries are routed to ElectionCenter)
	
Design Patterns used:
	-Singleton (ElectionCenter.java is a singleton to avoid votes being sent and tallied in different places)
	-Strategy (WinnerStrategy.java for ElectoralVoteStrategy, PopularVoteStrategy)
	-Iterator (used in many places, particularly in the engines)
	-Template (PrinterTemplate.java, used to print final Election results)
