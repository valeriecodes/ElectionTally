Final project

To run, import into Eclipse and run MyMain.java. You will also need to run active MQ on port 62060.
It takes a few minutes to populate and process the queues, so feel free to make 
yourself some tea while it does its work or continually refresh http://localhost:8260/admin/queues.jsp.

Note that because the assignment didn't call for parallel processing I did not implement it, but that the
different steps of the processing are designed in such a way that they could be run in parallel, except 
for the final calculation portion by the PopularVote and ElectoralVote strategies.

For my project, I implemented an election system. It generates ballots, sends them to precincts, which 
summarize them in batches and send them to the election center, where they are tallied. Once tallies are 
finalized, the results are calculated by the PopularVoteEngine, the ElectoralVote engine, or both. 
MyMain goes through all of these steps and prints out a summary of the election results.

EIP Patterns used:
	-Aggregator (Summarizing messages at the Precinct to send to the ElectionCenter, 
	see Precinct.java and MyAggregationStrategy.java)
	-Endpoint (Used in multiple places: from BallotMaker to Precinct, Precinct to ElectionCenter)
	-Polling Consumer (Used by electionCenter to receive summary messages from queue)
	-Message (Ballots are messages of a specific format)
	-Message router (Ballots are routed to precinct queues, then summaries are routed to ElectionCenter)
	
Design Patterns used:
	-Singleton (ElectionCenter.java is a singleton to avoid votes being sent and tallied in different places)
	-Strategy (WinnerStrategy.java for ElectoralVoteStrategy, PopularVoteStrategy)
	-Iterator (used in many places, particularly in the engines)
	-Template (PrinterTemplate.java, used to print final Election results)
