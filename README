To run, import into Eclipse and run MyMain.java. You will also need to run active MQ on port 62060.
It takes a little while to populate and process the queues, so feel free to make 
yourself some tea while it does its work or continually refresh http://localhost:8260/admin/queues.jsp.

Note that because the assignment didn't call for parallel processing I did not implement it, but that the
different steps of the processing are designed in such a way that they could be run in parallel.

For my project, I implemented an election system.
